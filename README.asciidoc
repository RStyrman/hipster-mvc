= Hipster MVC

The MVC library for Dart, inspired by Backbone.js and used extensively in the Pragmatic Programmers book, "Dart for Hipsters".

http://eee-c.github.com/hipster-mvc[API Documentation].

== Getting Started

A fully functional sample app is available at https://github.com/eee-c/dart-comics[dart-comics].

Displaying a collection of resources is as simple as defining model, collection and collection view classes and then instantiating them:

----
#import('Collections.Comics.dart', prefix: 'Collections');
#import('Views.Comics.dart', prefix: 'Views');

main() {
  var my_comics_collection = new Collections.Comics()
    , comics_view = new Views.Comics(
        el:'#comics-list',
        collection: my_comics_collection
      );

  my_comics_collection.fetch();
}
----

If the backend exposes a REST-like API, your collection and model classes can be very brief.

=== A Collection Example

----
#library('Collection class to describe my comic book collection');

#import('package:hipster-mvc/HipsterCollection.dart');

#import('Models.ComicBook.dart');

class Comics extends HipsterCollection {
  get url => '/comics';
  modelMaker(attrs) => new ComicBook(attrs);
}
----

=== A Model Example

----
#library('Model class describing a comic book');

#import('package:hipster-mvc/HipsterModel.dart');

class ComicBook extends HipsterModel {
  ComicBook(attributes) : super(attributes);
}
----
